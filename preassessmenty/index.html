        <h2>MyAssessment</h2> <!-- Hey Thomas -->
        <p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/67/4a/f3674a5ac37e095aa6fed708e61684b4.jpg" title="based world billionaire">The</a> most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
        <img src="../preassessmenty/assets/img/content-image2.jpg" id="dav"></img>
        <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
        <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
        <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute. </h4>
        <p>I believe alt is what shows up if it fails to load and title is a disciption that appears when you hover the object</p>
        <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
