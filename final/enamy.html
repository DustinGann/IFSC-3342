                    <p class="indented">Coil-Heads, also known as Spring Men, are tall, humanoid entities. They are eyeless mannequins with agape mouths, no forearms and a flexible spring for a neck. Their bodies are punctured with nails that are surrounded by what seem to be stains of blood.

                        Coil-Heads are difficult to counter when alone, more especially if you're dealing with another harmful entity at the same time.

                        Thumpers are a carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their name comes from the fact that Their arms are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.

                        They are vicious predators capable of treading in near silence, until its too late.
